# LeetCode Solutions - SQL

This repository provides a carefully curated collection of SQL solutions for various LeetCode problems, organized around fundamental SQL concepts. It is designed to support anyone looking to strengthen their SQL skills through practical problem-solving. The repository covers a wide range of SQL topics, each demonstrated through real-world examples and optimized queries. 

## Repository Overview

The solutions included span from basic to advanced SQL topics, offering insights into each concept’s usage and optimization. Topics covered include:

- **Control Flow and Conditional Logic**: Solutions that demonstrate the use of conditional statements like `CASE` and flow control to handle complex logic within queries. These examples showcase scenarios where data needs to be processed or transformed based on specific conditions.

- **Functions**: Includes examples of both aggregate functions (such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`) and scalar functions (like `ROUND`, `ABS`, `LENGTH`) that are often used to summarize or process data in useful ways.

- **Joins**: Comprehensive solutions that illustrate various types of joins (e.g., INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER) to combine data across multiple tables. These examples are crucial for understanding relationships in relational databases and extracting meaningful insights from connected datasets.

- **Numerical and String Processing**: Provides solutions involving numerical functions and string manipulations, such as calculations, string replacements, concatenations, and format adjustments. These skills are vital for data transformation and preparation tasks.

- **Data Selection and Ordering**: A variety of examples that cover `SELECT` statements, filtering with `WHERE`, and sorting with `ORDER BY`. These basic yet powerful SQL operations form the foundation of any database query.

- **Unions and Set Operations**: Solutions using `UNION` and `UNION ALL` to combine results from multiple queries, demonstrating how to handle large, diverse datasets and retrieve comprehensive results across tables.

Each solution is crafted to provide clear, optimal results while following best practices in SQL querying. The examples are also well-commented to explain the purpose and outcome of each line, making it easy for readers to understand both the syntax and the logic.

## Purpose and Usage

This repository serves multiple purposes:

1. **Learning Resource**: Whether you’re new to SQL or looking to solidify your skills, this repository provides structured guidance through practical examples. Each problem solution reinforces SQL syntax, key concepts, and query optimization techniques.
